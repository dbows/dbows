Hey I am @dbows.  I am a developer and creator at heart.  I had my first software company at 19 and have turned that into a life long career in software engineering. 

Through my career I have a ton of experience on large scale backend transactional systems as well as complex front-ends that users love to interact with.  But my real love is digging into performance and scalability issues.
